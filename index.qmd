# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is supposed to be an experiment to use Quarto & GH Actions to document my journey in exploring the fastHTML ecosystem.

Why fastHTML? I suppose it is inspired by the fact that Jeremy Howard feels it is the best way to create web apps & I want to explore if I can create web apps that are oriented towards data science applications.

The idea is to figure out a way to rapidly create data applications & dashboards within the GH ecosystem.

This is a Quarto book.
